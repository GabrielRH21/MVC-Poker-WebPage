#### The Model View Controller pattern

Model-View-Controller (MVC) is an architectural design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides application logic into three related elements. This division is made to separate the internal representation of the information (model) from the ways in which the information is presented (viewed) and accepted by the user (controller). This pattern has traditionally been used for desktop graphical user interfaces (GUIs), and has become popular for web application design as well.
